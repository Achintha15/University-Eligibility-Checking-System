# University-Eligibility-Checking-System
1) Background &amp; Motivation  Today, there are 10,390 government schools. The curriculum offered is approved by the Ministry of Education. 
Literacy rates and educational attainment levels rose steadily after Sri Lanka became an independent nation in 1948 and today the youth literacy rate stands 97%. The government gives high priority to improving the national education system and access to education.  In addition to the Government schools there are 33 non-fee-levying Assisted Private Schools and 33 fee-levying autonomous Private schools.   
Sri Lanka has 15 universities, all of which are public institutions. 
Admission at the undergraduate level to these public universities is based solely on the results of the G.C.E (A/L) Examination and the Z-score, which considers the difficulty level of the subjects. 
Only 6% of the students who sit the examination are admitted to the universities. Due to restricted facilities admissions have become competitive.    

2) Problem Domain  When applying to universities through the existing admission system students face a huge difficulty while applying to the most suitable degree program. They have to go through a complex system to submit their application. 
Most of them get rejected because of the drawbacks caused by them during the completion of the application form. 
So we discussed designing a system to overcome the above-discussed scenario. The system is to simplify the workload that has to face when applying for the universities. This will be more helpful for all the users to get a clear idea about their eligibility without confusing.   

3) Aim We will design a website for the government sector including all the eligible degree programs related to each range of Z-scores and the universities which offered the selected degree program providing a user-friendly interface for its users.
